/*
  NumberBlinker
  Blinks an LED to communicate a number.
  The number is 'The answer to life, the universe, and everything'

// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// Give Pin 13 a name:
int led = 13;
// Define a constant for delay
const int timer = 150;

// The setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {                
  // Initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);     
}

// Define function for blinking LED
void blinker(int iters){
  for (int i = 0; i < iters; i++){ // Runs 'iters' number of times
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);       // Turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
    delay(timer);                  // Let LED remain on
    digitalWrite(led, LOW);        // Turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
    delay(timer*1.3);              // Delay between blinks
  }
}

// The loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  blinker(4);       //Call blinker function for 4 blinks
  delay(timer*2.5); //Delay between numbers
  blinker(2);       // Call blinker function for 2 blinks
  delay(timer*7);   // Delay before repeat
}
